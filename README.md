# Cros-Root
My custom scripts used to root the Chrome OS that comes on chromebook machines, with some extra goodies, enjoy.
My normal choices for firmware are 1,n and then 6,y followed by a reboot.

WARNING!

THIS SCRIPT DOES REMOVE THE ANDROID APPS ABILITY ON YOUR CHROMEBOOK!
	If you wish to keep Android apps, I suggest you comment out lines 12-17 in the cros/fst/root file.
